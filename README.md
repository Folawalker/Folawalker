Welcome to the world of Folawalker, where the magic of data analysis meets the intrigue of detective work! I’m not just crunching numbers—I’m solving data mysteries, plotting (literally) stories, and turning messy datasets into elegant insights.

🧐 What’s This All About?

Picture this: a world where discounts drive sales, and prices alter customer behavior. With a trusty toolkit of Python, SQL, and an obsession for clean data, I’ve set out to crack the code behind the trends. Spoiler alert: the answer is usually hidden in the data—sometimes you just have to ask the right questions or run the right queries.


🚀 Featured Cases

Discount & Sales Dynamics: The Deal Detective Case 🛍️
- Discounts, Because Nothing Sells Like a Good Deal: "More discounts, more sales. Is it that simple? Spoiler: kinda, yeah."
- Summary: An analysis exploring how discount percentages impact customer purchases, proving that a good deal can do wonders for sales.

 🛠️ Tools of the Trade

- Python: My magnifying glass for uncovering patterns with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
- SQL: The interrogation room for data, where I ask the tough questions and get straight answers.
- Data Visualization: Because sometimes, a picture is worth a thousand rows of data. Enter Matplotlib and Seaborn for charts that *speak volumes*.
- Data Cleaning: Before solving the mystery, I like to make sure the dataset isn’t hiding any skeletons in the closet—looking at you, usually in form of null values, outliers or even inappropriate parameters.

💡 Skills & Specialties

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Asking the right questions to let the data do the talking.
- Data Wrangling: Wrestling messy datasets into submission like a pro.
- Storytelling with Data: Every dataset has a story; it just needs someone to tell it right. 📊✨
